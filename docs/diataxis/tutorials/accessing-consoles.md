## Understanding Console Types

### Console Architecture in HyperShift Lab

In the OpenShift HyperShift Lab, you'll encounter different types of consoles:

1. **Management Cluster Console**: The main cluster that hosts control planes
2. **Hosted Cluster Consoles**: Individual cluster consoles for each hosted cluster
3. **ArgoCD Console**: GitOps management interface
4. **Monitoring Consoles**: Grafana and other monitoring tools

## Step 1: Access the Management Cluster Console

The management cluster console is your primary entry point.

### Finding the Management Cluster URL

Your management cluster console URL follows this pattern:
```
https://console-openshift-console.apps.<management-cluster-name>.<domain>
```

**Example**: `https://console-openshift-console.apps.management-cluster.example.com`

### Logging Into the Management Console

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Navigate to the management cluster console URL**
3. **Handle certificate warnings** (if any):
   - Click "Advanced" if you see a security warning
   - Click "Proceed to site" or "Accept the risk"
   - This is normal for development environments
4. **Choose your login method**:
   - **OpenShift OAuth**: Use your OpenShift credentials
   - **Identity Provider**: Use your organization's SSO if configured
5. **Enter your credentials** and click "Log in"

### Exploring the Management Console

1. **Dashboard Overview**: See cluster health and status
2. **Navigation Menu**: Access all cluster management features
3. **Project Selector**: Switch between different namespaces
4. **User Menu**: Account settings and logout options

## Step 2: Identify Available Hosted Clusters

### Finding Hosted Clusters

From the management cluster console:

1. **Navigate to Workloads > Pods**
2. **Select the `clusters` namespace** from the project dropdown
3. **Look for hosted cluster resources**:
   - Pods with names like `dev-cluster-01-*`
   - Control plane components for each hosted cluster

### Available Hosted Clusters

In this environment, you have access to:
- `dev-cluster-01` - Development environment
- `dev-cluster-02` - Additional development environment
- `example-instance` - Example/template cluster
- `cluster-template` - Template cluster

## Step 3: Access Hosted Cluster Consoles

### Understanding Hosted Cluster URLs

Hosted cluster consoles use nested subdomain patterns:
```
https://console-openshift-console.apps.<hosted-cluster-name>.apps.<management-cluster-name>.<domain>
```

**Examples**:
- dev-cluster-01: `https://console-openshift-console.apps.dev-cluster-01.apps.management-cluster.example.com`
- dev-cluster-02: `https://console-openshift-console.apps.dev-cluster-02.apps.management-cluster.example.com`

### Accessing Your First Hosted Cluster

1. **Open a new browser tab** (keep the management cluster tab open)
2. **Navigate to dev-cluster-01 console**:
   ```
   https://console-openshift-console.apps.dev-cluster-01.apps.management-cluster.example.com
   ```
3. **Log in using the same credentials** as the management cluster
4. **Notice the differences**:
   - Different cluster name in the header
   - Separate projects and resources
   - Independent cluster metrics

### Exploring the Hosted Cluster Console

1. **Check the cluster name**: Look at the top of the console
2. **View cluster nodes**: Go to Compute > Nodes
3. **Explore projects**: Each hosted cluster has its own projects
4. **Check resource usage**: Home > Overview shows cluster-specific metrics

## Step 4: Manage Multiple Console Sessions

### Browser Tab Organization

1. **Use descriptive tab titles**:
   - Rename tabs for easy identification
   - Use browser bookmarks with clear names

2. **Organize tabs by function**:
   - Tab 1: Management cluster (main control)
   - Tab 2: Primary development cluster (dev-cluster-01)
   - Tab 3: Secondary development cluster (dev-cluster-02)
   - Tab 4: ArgoCD (if needed)

### Browser Bookmarks Strategy

Create organized bookmarks:

```
OpenShift HyperShift Lab/
├── Management Cluster
├── Development Clusters/
│   ├── dev-cluster-01
│   ├── dev-cluster-02
│   └── example-instance
└── Tools/
    ├── ArgoCD
    └── Monitoring
```

### Using Browser Profiles

For complex environments, consider using browser profiles:

1. **Development Profile**: For development clusters and tools
2. **Production Profile**: For production access (if applicable)
3. **Personal Profile**: For personal projects and learning

## Step 5: Access ArgoCD Console

ArgoCD provides GitOps management for your clusters.

### Finding ArgoCD

1. **From the management cluster console**
2. **Navigate to Networking > Routes**
3. **Select the `openshift-gitops` project**
4. **Look for the ArgoCD route**
5. **Click on the route URL** to access ArgoCD

### ArgoCD Login

1. **Use OpenShift OAuth** if configured
2. **Or use admin credentials** if provided
3. **Explore the ArgoCD interface**:
   - Application overview
   - Sync status
   - Git repository connections

## Step 6: Troubleshoot Console Access Issues
