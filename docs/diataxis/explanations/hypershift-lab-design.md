# OpenShift HyperShift Lab Design and Architecture

This document explains the design philosophy, architectural decisions, and unique characteristics of the OpenShift HyperShift Lab project.

## Project Purpose and Vision

### What is the OpenShift HyperShift Lab?

The OpenShift HyperShift Lab is a **comprehensive GitOps-based framework** designed to demonstrate and enable hosted OpenShift clusters using HyperShift technology. It provides a complete environment for:

- **Learning HyperShift**: Understanding hosted control plane concepts
- **Development and Testing**: Multi-cluster development environments
- **GitOps Patterns**: Demonstrating ArgoCD-based cluster management
- **Multi-Platform Support**: KubeVirt and AWS platform integration

### Why This Project Exists

Traditional OpenShift deployments require dedicated control plane nodes for each cluster, leading to:
- **High Resource Costs**: Each cluster needs 3+ control plane nodes
- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple independent clusters
- **Limited Scalability**: Resource overhead limits cluster density

The HyperShift Lab addresses these challenges by:
- **Shared Control Planes**: Multiple clusters share management cluster resources
- **GitOps Automation**: Declarative cluster lifecycle management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Higher cluster density with lower overhead
- **Simplified Operations**: Centralized management and monitoring

## Architectural Philosophy

### Progressive Architecture Design

The lab follows a **progressive architecture** approach:

```
Foundation → Preparation → Management → Hosted Clusters Platform
```

**Decision**: All configuration managed through Git and ArgoCD
**Rationale**: 
- Declarative configuration ensures consistency
- Version control provides audit trail and rollback capability
- Automated synchronization reduces operational overhead
- Industry best practice for cluster management

#### 2. External Secrets Integration
**Decision**: Use External Secrets Operator for credential management
**Rationale**:
- No secrets stored in Git repositories (security)
- Centralized credential management (operational efficiency)
- Automatic secret synchronization (automation)
- RHACM-compatible patterns (enterprise integration)

#### 3. Multi-Platform Support
**Decision**: Abstract platform differences behind common APIs
**Rationale**:
- Flexibility to choose appropriate platform for workloads
- Vendor independence and portability
- Consistent user experience across platforms
- Future extensibility to new platforms

#### 4. Bare Metal Foundation
**Decision**: Use c5n.metal instances for the foundation cluster
**Rationale**:
- KVM virtualization support for nested workloads
- High-performance networking (100 Gbps)
- Large memory capacity (192+ GB) for multiple control planes
- Optimal for hosting multiple cluster control planes

## Unique Technical Innovations

### 1. Nested Subdomain Architecture

**Challenge**: Hosted clusters need unique DNS names and SSL certificates
**Solution**: Nested subdomain pattern with wildcard certificate inheritance

```
Management: console-openshift-console.apps.mgmt-cluster.domain.com
Hosted:     console-openshift-console.apps.hosted-cluster.apps.mgmt-cluster.domain.com
```

**Innovation**: Wildcard policy configuration enables certificate inheritance
```bash
oc patch ingresscontroller default --type=json \
  -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {"wildcardPolicy": "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
```

### 2. Automated Domain Detection

**Challenge**: Scripts must work across different management cluster environments
**Solution**: Automatic domain detection from management cluster configuration

```bash
# Auto-detect management cluster domain
BASE_DOMAIN=$(oc get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}')
```

**Benefits**:
- Scripts work in any environment without modification
- Reduces configuration errors
- Simplifies deployment across different domains

### 3. GitOps-Driven Cluster Creation

**Challenge**: Traditional cluster creation requires manual steps and CLI tools
**Solution**: Git-based cluster creation with ArgoCD ApplicationSets

**Workflow**:
1. Script generates GitOps configuration
2. Developer commits to Git
3. ArgoCD ApplicationSet automatically discovers and deploys
4. Cluster becomes available without manual intervention

### 4. External Secrets Pattern

**Challenge**: Hosted clusters need credentials without storing secrets in Git
**Solution**: External Secrets Operator with centralized credential store

**Pattern**:
```
virt-creds namespace (central store) → ExternalSecret → Hosted cluster credentials
```

**Benefits**:
- Security: No secrets in Git
- Automation: Automatic credential synchronization  
- Scalability: Easy to add new clusters
- Compliance: Centralized credential management

## Platform Integration Strategies

### Certificate Management Strategy

**Challenge**: Hosted clusters use nested subdomains that exceed standard wildcard coverage
**Solution**: Ingress wildcard policy + certificate inheritance

**Standard Wildcard**: `*.apps.mgmt-cluster.domain.com`
**Hosted Cluster URL**: `console.apps.hosted-cluster.apps.mgmt-cluster.domain.com`
**Result**: Certificate mismatch without wildcard policy

**Fix**: Enable `WildcardsAllowed` policy to accept nested subdomain routes with inherited certificates.
