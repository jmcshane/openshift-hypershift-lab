## Contributing to Documentation

This documentation follows the Di√°taxis framework principles:

1. **Strict Audience Separation**: End-user docs never contain development instructions
2. **Purpose-Driven Content**: Each section serves a specific user need
3. **Factual Accuracy**: Reference documentation is directly verifiable from code
4. **Clear Uncertainty**: When making inferences, we state them clearly

For documentation contributions, see [Development Setup](how-to-guides/developer/development-setup.md).
